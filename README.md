**Exploring the Mini-Apps:**

The Svelte MiniApps project showcases a collection of pre-built mini-apps. You can simply clone this repository and run the development server to explore existing functionalities.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-obele/svelte-mini-apps.git
cd svelte-mini-apps
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm run dev  # Start the development server
```

This will launch a local server and open all available mini-apps in your browser window. Navigate through the different functionalities and see how they work.
